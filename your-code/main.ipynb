    "\n",
    "**What Does `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` Do?**\n",
    "- In Python, `__name__` is a special variable that tells you whether the script is being run directly or imported as a module.\n",
    "  - When you run the script directly, `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "  - When the script is imported into another script, `__name__` is set to the name of the module (e.g., the filename without the `.py` extension).\n",
    "- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the code inside it **only runs when the script is executed directly**, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "  - This is useful for including test code or example usage that should only run when you're testing or running the script directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "- When you run the script directly, the `print` statements inside the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block will execute:\n",
    "  - `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` becomes `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`.\n",
    "  - `[1, -2, 3, -4, 5]` becomes `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`.\n",
    "  - An empty list `[]` remains `[]`.\n",
    "- If you import this script into another script, the `print` statements will **not run**, and you can safely use the `additive_inverse` function without side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The function works for both positive and negative numbers.\n",
    "- It handles edge cases, such as an empty list, gracefully.\n",

    "1. **Arguments Passed:**\n",
    "   - `first = 1`: The first term of the sequence is `1`.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **List Comprehension Execution:**\n",
    "   - The loop `for i in range(l)` will iterate over `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4` (since `range(5)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`).\n",
    "   - For each `i`, the term is calculated as `first + c * i`:\n",
    "     - When `i = 0`: `1 + 2 * 0 = 1`\n",
    "     - When `i = 1`: `1 + 2 * 1 = 3`\n",
    "     - When `i = 2`: `1 + 2 * 2 = 5`\n",

    "     - When `i = 4`: `1 + 2 * 4 = 9`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resulting List:**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",

    "**Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "- The function `sum_of_multiples` calculates the sum of all **natural numbers below `n`** that are multiples of `3` or `5`.\n",
    "- It uses a **generator expression** inside the `sum()` function to iterate through all numbers from `1` to `n-1` (`range(1, n)`).\n",
    "- The condition `if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0` ensures that only numbers divisible by `3` or `5` are included in the sum.\n",
    "- If `n` is less than or equal to `0`, the function returns `0` (as specified in the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "1. **For `n = 10`:**\n",
    "   - Natural numbers below `10` are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n",
    "   - Multiples of `3` or `5` are `[3, 5, 6, 9]`.\n",
    "   - Their sum is `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23`.\n",
    "   - Output: `23`.\n",
    "2. **For `n = 20`:**\n",
    "   - Natural numbers below `20` are `[1, 2, 3, ..., 19]`.\n",
    "   - Multiples of `3` or `5` are `[3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18]`.\n",
    "   - Their sum is `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78`.\n",
    "   - Output: `78`.\n",
    "3. **For `n = -5`:**\n",
    "   - Since `n` is negative, the function returns `0`.\n",
    "   - Output: `0`.\n",
    "4. **For `n = 0`:**\n",
    "   - Since `n` is `0`, there are no natural numbers below `0`, so the function returns `0`.\n",
    "   - Output: `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The function handles edge cases, such as negative numbers and `0`, gracefully.\n",
    "- It ensures that numbers divisible by both `3` and `5` (e.g., `15`) are counted only once.\n",
    "- The use of a generator expression makes the code concise and efficient.\n",
    "- The range starts from `1` to exclude `0`, as `0` is not a natural number."

    "**Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "- The function `queue_time_counter` calculates the total time it takes for a specific person in a queue to get all their tickets.\n",
    "- The queue is represented as a list of integers, where each integer is the number of tickets a person needs.\n",
    "- The `position` parameter indicates the initial position of the target person in the queue (0-based index).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `time` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the total time elapsed.\n",
    "2. **Processing the Queue:**\n",
    "   - For each minute (`time += 1`), the first person in the queue gets one ticket (`queue[0] -= 1`).\n",
    "   - If the first person is the target (`position == 0`) and they have no more tickets to get (`queue[0] == 0`), the loop breaks, and the total time is returned.\n",
    "3. **Rotating the Queue:**\n",
    "   - If the first person still needs more tickets (`queue[0] > 0`), they are moved to the end of the queue (`queue.append(queue.pop(0))`).\n",
    "   - If the first person is done (`queue[0] == 0`), they are removed from the queue (`queue.pop(0)`).\n",
    "4. **Updating the Target Position:**\n",
    "   - If the target person is not at the front of the queue, their position is updated (`position = position - 1 if position > 0 else len(queue) - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "- For the queue `[2, 5, 3, 4, 6]` and target position `2`:\n",
    "  - The target person needs `3` tickets and is initially in the 3rd position (index `2`).\n",
    "  - The function simulates the queue process and returns the total time taken for the target person to get all their tickets.\n",
    "  - Output: `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The function handles the queue rotation and ticket distribution efficiently.\n",
    "- It ensures the target person's position is updated correctly as the queue changes.\n",
    "- The loop continues until the target person receives all their tickets."
